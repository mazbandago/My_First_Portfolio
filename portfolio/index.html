        <h3>My First Coding Experience</h3>
        <p>My coding experience began with an application to roll in as an ALX student. I went through two months of tutulage to know the rudiments of the tech world. After that, i was enrolled into the front end web development cohort of the ALX program. Cohort 4 is my class as there are many of my colleagues who are in a different cohord. To start with, i was taught to understand version control. I was introduced to Git and GitHub as the most popular version control system. This build my confidence in the world of ICT. I was then asked to download visual studio code as the editor for coding. Then i was taken through the rudiments of how to use the VScode for writting code. Through this, i build my first project using only HTML.</p>
        <h4>My First Project</h4>

        <h3>Coding Gets Better with Inclusion of Twitter page</h3>
        <p>Having been able to get pass my first coding experience, i was introduced to another task of how to incorporate a tweeter page in an HTML page. It was not difficult at all. Follow the instruction and you will be able to do it. It was refreshing and excitting to view a page developed by the whole me. I could not believe it the moment i view the page and saw every single thing i did with my own hands. Before my journey with ALX, i saw web development like a magic, created in India and loaded on our computers and phones.</p>
